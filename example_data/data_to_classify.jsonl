{"text": "I remember it being one of the best shows of the season when it was released. Now i'm re-watching it via Netflix. The other reviews here don't make sense to me. I do want to see the Britsh version, but I'm glad i didn't see it first. The gist of reviews is that this is a pale comparison, which doesn't mean much.<br /><br />I remember before it premiered, the buzz was mostly questioning whether the US was ready for such an \"unpleasant\" central character. I found Fitz pleasantly realistic and not nearly so obnoxious as the press indicated. The show has a great deal more depth than much of what's on, plus a large dose of simple everyday realism compared with most current dramas (where's Bochco when he's needed?)<br /><br />Currently there seem to be two schools of drama; both rather irritating: In one, focus on characters is maximized but events are somehow super-heightened as to be unreal. Kind of soaps on steroids that grind you down after a while: i.e. Grey's Anatomy<br /><br />The other is the gimmick show, started by ER, which focuses so heavily on it's supposedly clever concept, usually some scientific subject usually just off the radar of common folk, the characters are virtually forgotten; mere robots carrying on the activity necessary to illustrate the subject: Any of the CSI's, Criminal Minds, Numbers, Lie To Me, and a few dozen others they've spawned.<br /><br />Cracker was not clich\u00e9d. It was character driven without forgetting to have interesting goings on, and didn't try to twist the viewer into knots with every plot turn.<br /><br />Fitz reminds me quite a bit of Dr. House, especially now that show has lost it's sense of humor as well as the cast and formula that made it great. Cracker was never as brilliant as House began, but then there's plenty of room for both sorts. Perhaps the character of Fitz WAS before the time was right.", "include": 1}

The actors that they had portray Ryan Phillippe's Christian and Sarah Michelle Gellar's Kathryn are very poor substitutes indeed. Neither can pull off the smarmy, snooty rich-kid attitude that the original actors did. It's absolutely appalling that some of the dialog was verbatim -- not so much between Christian and Kathryn, but if you listen closely enough you'll recognize it. There are also inconsistencies in the plot - if this were truly the first meeting of Christian and Kathryn, then why is it that Christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the movie? He supposedly was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie (with Reese Witherspoon's character).<br /><br />Also, the tie-in with the photography/\"You could be a model\" comment at the end was totally lame and didn't add anything at all.

{"text": "Even though it looked from the box like this movie was low-budget, with a cast of unknowns, I thought it might have some possibilities as a mystery story. I discuss the plot below but do not give away key details.<br /><br />In this 1999/2000 movie, a down-on-her-luck-with-men career woman played by Andrea Roth works at an ill-defined sales firm or ad agency for an apparently kinky boss (Rae Dawn Chong). Chong invites her out to party at the raunchy nightclub \"Pork.\" Roth has just broken up with a \"needy\" nerd boyfriend who keeps calling and following her. At Pork, Roth is attracted to but repulsed by a crass, slick-hair, leather-jacketed, cigarette-hanging-out-of-the-mouth \"bad boy\" (Linden Ashby).<br /><br />Soon, Roth returns to the club alone and picks him up. In one of a number of confusing, poorly presented physical scenes over the course of the film, she lets him press against her and hang her over her apartment balcony railing. It is not clear whether this is meant to pass for wild sex or (as Roth seems to gossip to Chong) just elaborate, get-acquainted foreplay for a later session.<br /><br />Meanwhile back at the office, Chong promotes Roth over two macho jerk co-workers (one of whom Roth is rumored to have dated). Roth comes over to their table at a restaurant, where they are crudely bad-mouthing her under their breath, to try to give them a pep talk. She meets a shy, orange-haired, big-glasses accountant from the firm, who the other two put up to asking her out. He later joins her for a polite dinner at her place.<br /><br />As the increasingly sluggish movie drones on, Roth gets more involved with the bar punk but then tries to pull back when he grows so rough and possessive that it becomes abusive. The nerdy accountant, a shadowy brother, and the old boyfriend hover in the background. One of the macho jerks from the office ends up stabbed to death. The second soon meets the same fate. A scruffy, dogged young cop starts investigating, with the help of a tomboy waitress who wants more of his time.<br /><br />Roth's old boyfriend is arrested when a knife turns up in his car, but he claims he had nothing to do with the killings. Chong drops by Roth's apartment to console her depressed friend, feebly comes on to her, is rebuffed, and is later accosted by the jealous, angry bar punk. Another victim turns up, this time strangled in an alley. In a long, labored, violent scene, the psycho killer is confronted in Roth's apartment.<br /><br />The best that can be said about \"Dangerous Attraction\" is that slender, strawberry-blonde Roth looks pretty on screen, the cop and waitress are likable and make a cute couple, and there are a lot of suspects to confuse the issue for a while. Beyond that, the movie ends up being a frustrating failure.<br /><br />Early on, the film uses some touches that seem to hint at depth and creativity (such as Roth's cryptic narration over a hazy bike-riding scene and Chong's odd behavior). It throws in some melodramatic frills toward the end.<br /><br />But none of this can hide the fact that there is nothing special to the story, dialogue, cast, production values, or sets. The writing is far too thin to sustain the film, which becomes tedious, drawn-out, and overlong. By the time the movie grinds to a halt, with a final \"shock effect\" scene at a hospital (as much of a tacked-on gimmick as an earlier scene of a figure's silhouette in a wheelchair), you could not care less. The characters and acting are dull and flat, even in supposedly dramatic scenes (especially Ashby's annoying performance). No interesting color or detail is developed about the characters or the settings (their professions are mere window dressing). The detective work is almost non-existent. The film amounts to nothing more than an uninvolving, monotonous, surface-level effort that strings you along for what turn out to be cheap, shallow, trite, predictable, unsatisfying payoffs. The best description of the movie that I can think of is a thin crust of formula with no filling.<br /><br />There are also amateurish mistakes, going to substance and style, that make the movie feel like even more of a waste of time. A character gratuitously gives Roth the address of that person's apartment, which leads to a key plot point, when there is no way in the world the person would have wanted Roth to drop by. Chong is poorly used in the film. She is relegated to a lifeless performance in a bit part, and is unflatteringly dressed and photographed, making an attractive woman look old and overweight. For some reason, the movie comes up with nothing but drab sweat-suits for Roth to wear in most scenes (including when she hosts the accountant for dinner). And the love scenes are ruined by sloppy, obvious cutaways to a body double for Roth who does not even have the same shape. This is insulting and unprofessional. The movie has no business using nudity if all it does is to make scenes look fake.", "include": 1}
{"text": "I saw this for the first time recently, and simply had to comment even though the film is a few years old.<br /><br />This is the worst film that I have seen in years! Firstly, it hangs on the tails of the 'Broken Britain' tedious myth that is perpetrated and propagated by the likes of the Daily Mail. Certainly, all of the issues depicted by the film exist and are fully worthy of attention. But could they all exist at once? And do they all happen all the time? Is this what life is about in London today for the average teenager???? No! And that is only one of the reasons why this film is ridiculous.<br /><br />As for the characters, the lot of them could have been put up against a wall and shot and I would have applauded. For instance, I was glad Trife was killed \u0096 and I don't think that was the director's intention unless he's far more subtle than I give him credit for. In fact, they missed a trick here. The characters are so horrible that had they killed them off one-by-one a la Final Destination - instead of messing about with a laughable Romeo and Juliet plot (Pffffttt! Like anyone would care whether those toerags got back together or not!) - it would have been far more enjoyable. I would have particularly enjoyed seeing Katie's dad die in a freak laptop computer incident. I could go on, but I don't think it's healthy....<br /><br />Like I said at the start, I'm a bit confused about the 'Broken Britain' basket this thing sits in, and I really wonder what the intention of the director/screen writer was. Incredibly, an Asian director and a black scriptwriter seem to have come up with a propaganda film for the BNP that gets around the present hate laws. Here is my thinking: <br /><br />i. The black and mixed race pupils beat Katie: a tall, beautiful, middle class white girl, forcing her to admit to being a 'virgin' (by implication a heinous crime according to their 'black ass' thinking) leading her to commit suicide. Trife \u0096 a black boy - then 'stands up' for Katie by declaring that he had sex with her \u0096 thereby clearing her of her 'crime'. Hopefully he wasn't asked to speak at the funeral\u0085.<br /><br />ii. Then, after being given a day-off school for mourning and quiet reflection as a result of Katie's death, the black and mixed-race guys instead decide to go off on a spree of casual sex, violent confrontation, knife-wielding thuggery, drug taking and general mayhem on London's streets and shops \u0096 all set to various rap 'choons'. It is understood by all that the day will culminate in a 'well wicked party' where more of the same will transpire. Trife also finds a bit of time to visit his mentor: an uncle who (surprise) is a black, drug-dealing, murderous, violent, gun-running 'gangsta' who likes to carve his initials on people's faces with a Stanley knife.<br /><br />(Wot d'ya fink so far, Mr Griffin?) Let's carry on for a bit: <br /><br />iii. Encouraged by the example of the males, the late Katie's female classmates also opt for a contemplation-free day. Firstly, mixed-race Alisa kicks things off by announcing that she's pregnant in a mobile phone conversation. There is some confusion over who the father is, and this inspires the noble Trife \u0096 the recipient of the call and the father - to tell her to eff off. In order to help the tearful Alisa cope with this double blow of pregnancy and rejection, her friend Becky suggests a day of shopping, prostitution, casual sex and drugs. Alisa \u0096 after a bit of brow-furrowing - thinks this idea has potential. Off they go.<br /><br />iv. White girls: the characters of Becky and Claire are carefully drawn to conform to Daily Mail reader stereotypes of the 'type of white girls who hang around with blacks' i.e. total sluts. Becky will sleep with anyone for nothing (at the end she wonders around the 'well wicked' party asking people to service her) but prefers to do it for drugs and/or money. Claire, who's a bit more middle-class than Becky, will give you a quickie after twenty seconds of chimp chat-up - if she can fit you in whilst her boyfriend pops to the newsagent for a packet of cigs\u0085\u0085and Claire's mum will provide the condoms with a cheerful smile. Sam, ever the gentleman, threatens to publicly reveal Claire's personal hygiene problems. So what conclusion can we draw? I know! Smelly white female pigs doing it with blacks, ugh! Do I get a star, miss? <br /><br />v. Black misogyny: generally, black males in this film score poorly in aspects of courtly love. There are numerous examples but Sam's treatment of both Katie and Claire is pertinent, as is Uncle Curtis' slap of his girlfriend when she interrupts his cretinous musings and Trife's initial reaction to Alisa's pregnancy. Becky's boyfriend (a deliberately greasy/swarthy/foreign type) gloats over the fact that she's only fifteen and that he has such power over her. Trife charms a twenty-six year old white female architect (she being unaccountably attracted to him) but prefers to steal her purse. Etc, etc, etc. Sigh.<br /><br />The plot lacks all maturity, depth and development. One would be entirely forgiven for thinking that the scriptwriter was himself fifteen \u0096 if not younger. In short: this film would be pleasing to: <br /><br />\u0095 Some fifteen year old boys, who might feel disenfranchised by the way that the girls in their classroom are so very far ahead of them in maturity <br /><br />\u0095 BNP members, for whom it would make an ideal stocking filler<br /><br />Broken Britain, m'botty. One star for the teenage actors, and no stars for anything else.", "include": 1}
{"text": "And I've seen a lot of them. There is more stock footage in this thing than any movie I know except \"Jungle Hell\" (1956). The only difference is that \"Jungle Hell\" was all elephants. This one's all sea lions. On and on and on about the stupid sea lions while the stupid crew in their stupid boat looks for stupid Juan Francisco.<br /><br />Much of the stock footage that isn't sea lions is native women of the South Pacific. I don't know if the editors were blind or what, but whoever was in charge of splicing the stock footage together didn't seem to mind that the women were mongoloid one minute, negroid the next, and caucasoid the next. They change races with surprising speed.<br /><br />There is another prominent stock footage scene. An octopus in an aquarium (you can see him stick to the glass, and you can see the reflection of lights on the glass) battles a moray eel. The eel is defending all his little fish buddies from the mean old octopus. I'm not making this up. This is presented as if it were happening in the ocean for crying out loud. Who wins? Watch and find out!<br /><br />Lots of stock footage of men fishing provides for some humor as the overdubbed voices say things like, \"Watch out for my face.\" But it gets tiring after several minutes of the same stupid footage of the same stupid men catching the same stupid fish.<br /><br />Alas, there is one more big stock footage scene. This one's of the devil monster. It's not a devil, and it's not really a monster. What is it? Let's just say it's not the kind of monster you were hoping for. Juan, who they did find at the end of all those sea lions, battles the \"monster\". Again, you'll have to watch to find out what happens.<br /><br />What really surprises me is that the IMDB says this was edited down from a longer, older movie.

Parts that would make the movie seem more plausible and give an insite into the reason for the invasion in the first place are chopped to a couple of minutes.

The authorities (e.g. the President) are in almost from the start in the book, but not in the movie. More than one state is involved in the book, compared to three town in the movie.

{"text": "Viewers with an interest in British history might wish to note that since the first Hanoverian came to the British throne (George I in 1714) it has been occupied by dimwits. These dimwits have fallen into two classes \u0096 those like Victoria, George V, George VI and the present incumbent, who saw themselves as the slaves of duty and therefore as ceremonial heads of state did little or no harm, and those like George IV, Edward VII and Edward VIII who kicked over the traces, but did less damage than one might have expected. The 1936 abdication crisis was a crisis only for those who believe in monarchy, in this country a minority of about 25%, according to the 1999 Republic referendum. The story has been told several times before on TV \u0096 is there anything new about this 2005 ITV version, apart from the Baltic locations?.<br /><br />Well, the publicity says there's more of Wallis's side of the story here, but I can't say that's obvious, apart from there being a bit more of Wallis' Aunt Bessie (Miriam Margolyes). Edward is portrayed as the seducer (in a candlelight chalet in winter) but Wallis (nicely played by Joely Richardson) doesn't exactly play hard to get. She had rivals for the post of prince's mistress (Lady Furness and Mrs Ward) whom she easily defeats. At the end she was left with the baby, or at least the immature prince, a duchess without honour exiled to France. Stephen Campbell Moore is about 10 years too young for Edward but his puppy-like demeanour is appropriate. The triviality of the Windsors is shown by the fact that it wasn't the loss of the Crown that irked them so much as the establishment's refusal to give Wallis the title \"Her Royal Highness\". Diana, of course, had exactly the same beef, but then she was demoted on her divorce. Camilla (for the moment) is a mere duchess, but is also \"HRH\". Winston Churchill, robustly played here by David Calder, was a principal supporter of Edward just because he was a prince, but then Winston was a rather romantic old Tory.<br /><br />Nazi sympathies were not uncommon in the British upper classes prior to World War 2 (\"those Nazi chappies certainly know how to make the trains run on time\") but if an invasion of Britain by Germany had been successful (and it was a close\u0096run thing), Edward, given his sympathies would have been the front-runner for puppet King. Edward was an undistinguished governor of the Bahamas between 1940 and 1945 but the main reason for that appointment was to keep him out of the reach of the Nazis. (Down under we got his younger brother, Prince Henry, who was even dumber than Edward, as GG (1942-1945), but a bit better behaved). After that he and Wallis spent the remaining 27 years of their marriage in very comfortable and well-deserved obscurity in Paris. One is left with the feeling we got lucky.<br /><br />This production has a nice sheen to it and the 30s' era is well evoked. There are some other good performances, particularly 80 year old veteran Richard Johnston as Wallis' nemesis, prime minister Baldwin, and Julian Wadham as Edward's not exactly loyal private secretary Fitzhardinge.", "include": 1}

What a dazzling radiant star that burned so brightly for so short a time and then was so suddenly and prematurely snuffed out. But when an artist gives so much of herself in every song she sings, it is no wonder that her life was slowly drained and eventually terminated by the fans who loved her.<br /><br />I was working with The Canadian Film Institute in 1980, one year after the release of this film, and we put on a festival in Ottawa at the National Film Archives Theatre in July. We started out with \"The Rose\" at 8pm and then concluded with Crawley Films Academy Award winning Documentary film \"Janis\" at 11pm. It was just like a live Rock Concert. The crowd was in a frenzy. The only thing missing was Jimi Hendrix! Love this one. Real entertainment and excitement!<br /><br />I should note that the director, Mark Rydell, does an overview commentary on the DVD version of this film and it is like taking a university level cinematic studies course. He makes interesting and relevant comments on every scene in the film and it is well worth listening to. Highly informative and fascinating!", "include": 1}

However if they say bank before a question the money is safe. The reason this show is not like a normal game show is that the contestants work as a team, but they can get rid of a member (The Weakest Link). But the main reason for the game show being different is the host. Normally the host is nice, but Anne Robinson purposely acts nasty and the contestant leaves with nothing but the words \"You are the Weakest Link, Goodbye!\" Anne Robinson was number 25 on The 100 Worst Britons (for being mean), and she was number 46 on TV's 50 Greatest Stars.

{"text": "The Henry Hathaway-directed 1941 Shepherd Of the Hills is worth seeing if for nothing else its color, which is as glorious and gorgeous as one will find in a film. Each outdoor shot is like a landscape painting. Along with Gone With the Wind and The Four Feathers, this is the finest use of color I have seen in a movie, and it should be used as a textbook on how to shoot a film in color. Otherwise, the picture is just a pleasing and old-fashioned revenge tale, adapted from a now forgotten novel, and set in the Ozark Mountains at about the turn of the twentieth century. It is nicely written in the idiom of the mountain folk, and features John Wayne in an early, rare non-western role, which he handles proficiently. Betty Field is his spunky love interest in what would now be an Amy Madigan part. Miss Field is lovely in a non-conventional way; she shines as never before or since. The combination of her quiet, almost mousy beauty in an otherwise talky, assertive role is fascinating to watch. Also on hand are Beulah Bondi, Ward Bond, Marc Lawrence, who gives an amazing performance, and Harry Carey, whose pleasantness and plainness I find tiring, though I suppose he's well-cast. There's a ritualistic feeling to the film, with its clearly defined notions of good and evil, the almost formally informal dialect the characters use, the leisurely, strolling pace by which the story unfolds, all contribute to its pastoral quality. The chief problem is that there's no suspense. One senses early on how the thing is going to end, and the characters behave as one would expect.", "include": 1}

{"text": "This flaccid remake of Hitchcock's excellent thriller 'Dial M For Murder' dumps not only that great title but numerous chunks of the clever plot, and replaces them with twists of its own that are either predictable or old hat. Michael Douglas takes over from Ray Milland as a slimy rich chap married to unfaithful Gwyneth Paltrow; he blackmails her lover (Viggo Mortenson) into murdering her, but both his scheme and the movie go chronically wrong. The only good bits here are derived from the original play and Hitch's film, but it doesn't make a lot of difference as they're drowned in a stew of padding, unnecessary additional scenes and needless peripheral characters. Possibly the most visible blunder is that the murder set-up is far from perfect, although that's rivalled by silly plot holes like the one in which Douglas goes to Mortenson's apartment to retrieve his wife's wedding ring, thereby removing evidence of a connection between them, but neglects to do anything about the six-foot-wide painting OF HER FACE.

{"text": "The first thing that occurred to me when I was watching Welcome to Dongmakgol was that I was watching a Hayao Miyazaki film. This was simply because of the score and the setting, a near-magical isolated village, complete with folk lanterns and strange wildlife. That, and most notably, the fantastic score, which was composed by frequent Miyazaki collaborator, Joe Hisashi. But, despite some similar atmospheric elements to Miyazaki's oeuvre, the film is very much a Korean film.<br /><br />Set during the Korean war, two small groups of soldiers, North and South, respectively end up in very isolated Korean village in the mountains, in addition to a UN pilot who crashed there. When the two groups discover each other in the antiquated village (most of whom have never seen a gun before) a tense standoff occurs, which results in misfortune for the village. Driven by guilt (or responsibility), these two enemy groups have to learn to work together to fix their mistake. Meanwhile, the UN forces get antsy for their missing planes (which seem to mysteriously vanish over that mountain) and suspect a North Korean anti-aircraft base to be located on the mountain.<br /><br />While the story isn't without its logical hiccups, it's still a well told fantastic anti-war film, having the isolation in the village force all sides to have to deal with the humanity of the other. The film, based on a play by notable Korean screenwriter/playwright, Jang Jin, features a sense of humor characteristic of Jang's style, melting both the serious with the comic and criss-crossing genre lines as necessary. It's largely successful in this regard and the small plot holes are easily overlooked. Unfortunately, the near cartoonish UN villains (which includes a Korean man as the ignored conscience, along with some Korean goons) don't get the benefit of a nuanced portrayal.<br /><br />The picture looks fantastic, along with a couple surreal seaming fantasy sequences which fortunately disguise the weaknesses of some of the special effects. The art/production direction is quite enjoyable to view and I obviously don't have to repeat the merits of Hisashi's score. The direction itself is good as well. The acting, on the part of the Korean actors is strong, except where the characters are shallowly written. The American actors on the other hand are largely cartoons and hard to believe, even within the context of the movie. The lead American, Captain Smith (Steve Taschler), comes off a little better than his one- off peers, but his acting is uneven; whether it's due to his acting skills or his character's limited portrayal, I'm uncertain.<br /><br />Welcome to Dongmakgol has a lot going for it, especially its mix-up of fun, fantasy, comedy and drama, as well as its admirable message of harmony and unity. I found the fantastic elements a little ungainly, but the fantastic atmosphere was very well embellished, and drawing in Joe Hisashi was a stroke of genius for the film. While the film has some minor logical hiccups and treats its villains with much less nuance than its protagonists, it still remains a largely enjoyable yarn and worth watching for those that appreciate this sort of film. 7/10.", "include": 1}

{"text": "For my purposes, this title gets a 8 out of 10. Five for the movie itself, an extra two points for Mr. Spiner's diamond blue eyes, and one for the set designer who had the presence of mind to arrange Spiner's character's color scheme around them. Everything around \"Devlin Bowman\" is blue and white and the effect is quite striking.<br /><br />The movie is a ninety minute fart joke. I'm not kidding.<br /><br />Harold Gould, by far and away, delivers the best overall performance in the movie (such as it is). Casting James Brolin in this movie was a definite stroke of completely ridiculous genius. Austin Wolff is, of course, adorable, and Dana Carvey's particular brand of multiple personality disorder is as entertaining as ever (I got a definite chuckle out of Mr. Peru).<br /><br />Like I said, the movie is a ninety minute fart joke and is quite clearly directed at males between the ages of eight and twelve. If you have a roomful of those kind of people and you'd like them to stop breaking things by playing baseball with the ceiling fan, this movie will at least put them all in one room and occupy them with disgusting noises for about an hour and a half. There's no swearing. The (incredibly) mild \"blue\" content is really tame and based on a cartoony visual gag, as is the \"violence\". It's supposed to be a silly, sight gag based comedy and that's exactly what it is.<br /><br />As for Spiner (you knew I was getting to it); first of all, he's gorgeous. Like I said, the character's entire color scheme is a shade of electric blue that compliments his eyes to the point of being captivating. I was hitting the pause button just because I *had* to look. The jokes are (of course) at his character's expense (he *is* the bad guy, after all), and he, appropriately, rolls out his very best \"smarmy/irritated\" act (the one that stole \"Out To Sea\" right out from under two legends). It's amusing and relatively gentle right up until the climax of the movie, where he hits the \"crazy button\" and doesn't look back. Then it's just plain hilarious.

It was a period of ufanistic productions where one hero could destroy anything that threats America or its ideal of freedom. Films like Rambo II, Red Dawn, Commando or Rocky IV looked seen to be wrote by someone at Reagan's office, but at least they had some qualities. This Braddock had none. Chuck Norris leads the scariest cast of all times (M Emmet Walsh should be punished to do a film like that - how come he had done Blood Simple later?). The screenplay does not make any sense (Braddock kills a character vital to the story \u0096 a big shot Vietnam general \u0096 and there are no consequences), the action scenes are primary (the sequence with the boat \u0096 that should be the climax! - seems to be shot by high school students), the cinematography is awful (mixing up sequences on a bright day and others made on a numb one).

But it gets scared, and manages to escape into the small New Mexico town. The town becomes incredibly frightened, when one dead body is replaced with another each night and the evidence is pointing towards the leopard. Although Jerry doesn't believe it is the leopard doing the brutal killings, but someone using it to their advantage.<br /><br />\"The Leopard Man\" is another from the Val Lewton staple and it's probably his most unique one too. After directing the minor classics \"The Cat People\" and \"I Walk with a Zombie\", Jacques Tourneur returns with another successful stint in the power of suggestion with slick finesse and creepy atmosphere to boot. Tourneur's masterful direction carries the disjointed and fairly unconvincing screenplay by Adrel Wray. The interlocking structure that shifts back and forth between major and minor characters is an interesting (if ambitious) experiment for its time. While being well paced (since it just clocks over the hour mark), it plays more like separate little stories or set pieces to the bigger picture. This gave it an unpredictable pattern on who's going to get it next. This was achieved by the way chance-like camera-work sweeping across the screen onto different characters. Strangely enough the minor stories are far more interesting than the major one of Kiki and Jerry. The problem was I didn't particularly feel any sympathy for any of the characters (well, only the first victim) and the film's final revelation is rather flimsy and truly unfulfilling. Tourner likes to focus on the individually cold-hearted deaths with great skill and subdued intentions. The intensity he brings to the screen with great use of the camera, lighting, sound effects and the music score only added to the dramatic effect of each scene. This was enhanced by the hauntingly bone-rattling edge and eerily shadowy sets. He sure demonstrates some compelling patches that truly are blood curdling without the need of showering the viewer with too much detail. The first death scene is a perfect example. The performances are mostly fine from a fancy cast, if little underdone by Jean Brooks and Dennis O'Keefe. The problem is that they feel to glitzy than being down-to-earth folks. A zippy Margo definitely shines in her flamenco dancer role. Also floating by are sound turns from Ben Ward, Abner Biberman, Isabel Jewell, James Bell and Keefe Brasselle.<br /><br />What mostly keeps you involved with \"The Leopard Man\", is Tourneur's memorable touches and Margo's colourfully etched performance.", "include": 1}

First was the two leads and second, the filming location. Having being disappointed by the former, I was hoping that the latter would have been the saving grace. Being a Malaysian, I was eager to watch how the Petronas Twin Towers, currently the tallest building in the world, would have looked on the big screen. Of course, a sense of pride enveloped me when the first few glimpses of the majestic towers were shown. It is not often that major movie productions come here for filming. Although some scenes were manipulated (like the scene when Connery and Zeta-Jones were on a boat on the Malacca river with the Twin Towers on the background. Malacca and Kuala Lumpur are over 100 km apart!), I couldn't help but feel a sense of fulfillment whenever a familiar setting was shown. Notwithstanding the fact that none of the actors who potrayed Malaysians were actually from Malaysia. Perhaps \"Anna and the King\" starring Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fatt would do justice to talented local actors. This remains to be seen as the movie is still actively shooting here.<br /><br />In conclusion, I feel that unless you're a Malaysian, there's nothing that the movie can offer that's groundbreaking. You'll leave the cinema with a hollow feeling and will find yourself hard-pressed to recall a scene that will make an impact in your movie-going life.", "include": 1}

But the second season is so good!!!! Much more humor which i really liked! The best part of season two for me is the episode where they go to the spa (without alcohol en cellphones....) when they go back as fast as they can... hahaha....and then they get car trouble. They open the hood en they are staring at the engine. It was hilarious! <br /><br />In short. From season two i love this show!!!!!

But for the most part, it was full of light. A story of personal redemption for a man who felt more than guilty for seeing the wrongs that were happening yet chose to say and do nothing.<br /><br />Only one thing bothered me about the film -- I think at times Hildalgo looks at Hopkins with eyes that were perhaps computer-effected.<br /><br />I know that the story was an exaggeration, but it did not matter. It reminded me of the Tall Tales of Paul Bunyan, or Davy Crockett, or Daniel Boone. Did we ever question their \"truthfulness.\"<br /><br />I am tired of the cynical sophisticates who takes all joy out of life in the name of art and reallity. Is reallity television more real than Hidalgo. The reallity is that we need stories and myths to give power and meaning to our lives.

A spurned suitor for a girl's affections is scarier than the worms that attack the town with a vengeance. However, this twisted farm lad has his own plans for revenge. The cast isn't distinguished but Fran Higgins, a droll, rustic type, is spirited and has her moments, such as they are.

{"text": "I'd been awaiting this film's release for over a year now, and finally, after a bunch of problems with editing and whatnot, this movie got a DVD release. \"The Woods\" tells the story of a troubled girl named Heather (Agnes Bruckner), who is sent to a secluded private girls school in 1965 by her estranged parents after causing problems and lighting a tree on fire in their back yard. Ms. Traverse (Patricia Clarkson), along with two other women, run the old school. Heather doesn't seem to fit in at the school, and has a rough first week there, getting in scuffles with a snobby bully named Samantha (Rachel Nichols). Her only friend is Marcy, a quiet girl who is nice but shy. As she spends more time around the school, Heather has nightmares and hears strange voices, and is told the story of some witches who took over the school 100 years ago. As more strange events occur in and around the woods surrounding the school, girls begin to disappear.<br /><br />Unlike some, I found \"The Woods\" to be a satisfying horror film. I'll start off with the story - it's intriguing but derivative, I'd describe it as a hybrid of \"Suspiria\" and \"The Watcher in the Woods\", which are both films that I love, I might add. While it does borrow ideas from these films, it's nonetheless an imaginative and entertaining movie. The direction in the film was great - Lucky McKee, who spawned the unique fairy-tale-like horror film, \"May\", does a good job with this film. There are some really creative & spooky sequences and some nice cinematography to offer, plus the great '60s atmosphere was strongly present, brought to life through the costumes, sets, and the vintage score, and providing a perfect backdrop for the story to take place. I tend to have a soft spot for period pieces, so I really liked the time setting.<br /><br />The acting was on par and flowed naturally, the whole cast performed very well. Agnes Bruckner is likable in her role and Patricia Clarkson was great as the mysterious, something-isn't-quite-right-about-her Mrs. Traverse. Horror legend Bruce Campbell (of the \"Evil Dead\" series) plays Heather's father, although his role is pretty minor. And Rachel Nichols, who had a small role in the \"Amityville Horror\" remake, plays the rude school bully very well. There are some neat special effects used nicely throughout the film, and weren't too overdone. The CG was surprisingly really real-looking. I felt the conclusion of the of the film was slightly rushed, but I've seen films end much quicker than this, so for me it wasn't really a big deal. Plus, the ending features some great witch slashings via an axe, which was a nice addition to the film since the majority of it is gore free.<br /><br />Overall, \"The Woods\" is a satisfying horror movie. It's different, but it's imaginative and throughly entertaining, with a great story and a strong vintage atmosphere. Definitely not bad at all, especially for a horror period piece. Other than the slightly rushed conclusion, I can't really say anything bad about it. It took over a year to finally get a release (in any form), but the wait was well worth it. I love stuff like this, so it was almost perfect for me. One of the better horror films of the past year. 9/10.", "include": 1}
{"text": "I have been trying to find this movie for over the last 20yrs. Back in 1985, I saw the trailer for it on T.V. and it started out with an ice cream truck driving down the street. Some kids and adults gathered around the truck while the announcers stated that \"The Stuff\" was here. It's creamy, yummy and you can't get enough of it. Then it showed a man who had eaten about half his ice cream cone and the announcer changed his tone and said, \"It will take you over, eat you and kill you.\" and the camera zooms up on the guys mouth, and you can see the creamy white \"Stuff\" eating away the inside of his mouth. Bleah!! It was pretty gross and freaked me out back then. Something like this would have 4-10yrs old running from their T.V. sets. Talk about setting up kids for nightmares.<br /><br />I tried googling \"parasite eating ice cream\" to no avail, until one day on IMDb, I was looking up info on an old \"Snuff\" film from the 70's and saw \"The Stuff\" come up. Immediately, I knew this was the film. So I ran to the video store and was able to rent it.<br /><br />Not only was this movie, not scary, but the acting and the comedic nature were even worse. To make a long story short, here is the premise. Two guys working at a petroleum factory stumble across a pool of white creamy stuff in the ground. One of the guys sticks his finger in it and tastes it. Now I don't know about you, buy any normal person would never taste anything coming out of the ground unless it was water from a Spring pool. Anyway, the guy who tastes it says it taste real good. So good in fact, that they decide to market it as a new kind of ice cream treat, even though it's \"not\" ice cream. Before you know it, it's the best thing since the hot dog and everyone is eaten the stuff in gallons. People who try it, can't stop eating it. This causes other tasty treats on the market to lose profits. Several snack food manufacturers come together and hire an investigator to find out where and how this \"Stuff\" is made. In comes David 'Mo' Rutherford, the private detective who will investigate this tasty treat's mystery. He soon finds out that \"The Stuff\" is causing people to become uncontrollable zombies. The Stuff takes over their bodies and when it's done using them, it eats their insides and leaves through their mouths. It's alive. He also eventually finds out where this stuff is being stored.<br /><br />The special effects of this \"stuff\" is average at best. The movie \"The Blob\" (Steve McQueen) did a better job and that came out many years before this. The acting is pretty back. Only Michael Moriarty seems to be enjoying himself. Paul Sorvino and Danny Aiello are completely wasted in this film. Garrett Morris makes a short appearance, but he was actually better in \"Car Wash\" then in this campy horror flick. Actually, his scene is the only scary part in the film. You'll see.<br /><br />The whole movie is pretty far fetched and if this \"stuff\" was at retailers everywhere, wouldn't there be other investigators and even FBI agents investigating this problem? I think Larry Cohen was basically trying to send a message to consumers who constantly eat and drink the same bad foods day after day (Starbucks coffee, donuts, burgers, french fries and of course ice cream). He's saying don't eat this crap as it can eventually kill you, just like \"The Stuff\". We get it, but it still doesn't make the movie any better.<br /><br />I also think some of the scenes were removed from the film as well. Besides the ice cream truck scene in the trailer, I thought the poster scene with Jason's family in the kitchen on the floor being eaten by the Stuff was in the movie as well. It didn't show up on the DVD, so either it was cut or it never existed and I'm imagining things. A sequel to this movie could be interested if done right. The story of how the \"stuff\" is discovered would need to be changed of course, but an adequate sequel could be accomplished. Similar to how \"The Blobl\" was remade.<br /><br />This movie is not really worth a look. If you must see it, just rent it. It's not even a horror cult classic like The Cube, Phantasm, The Howling or Donnie Darko. I gave it a 4/10 and that was probably being generous. If you're going to made a comical horror film, watch Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 and take lots of notes. \"The Stuff\" isn't funny or scary. It's mostly a waste of time.", "include": 1}

{"text": "Coming to the IMDb site to review this commercially successful movie, I was amazed at the Oscar recognition it garnered in 1978 for what is, to my eyes and ears a very unremarkable re-make of the enjoyable 1941 Claude Rains feature \"Here Comes Mr Jordan\", while surreptitiously grafting on the title of another \"life after death\" 40's classic starring Don Ameche.<br /><br />I just don't have a lot to say about this vapid entertainment other than apart from transforming the hapless Joe from a boxer to an American footballer (and thus losing some of the universality of his character), it seems almost a line for line, scene for scene, inferior copy of the much superior original. Buck Henry and Elaine May were celebrated comedic writers of the time but I found nothing laugh-out-loud funny in what I saw and heard. The cinematography is merely average, soft focusing around Beatty & Christie's love scenes while the acting gig for all must have been the easiest payday they ever earned. Beatty plays every scene either with bemusement or winsomeness, Christie couldn't even be trusted to adopt an American accent and so we're expected to accept her Transatlantic-hopping English rose character who wins Beatty's heart with one flutter of an eyebrow or flick of her over-permed hair. Add to that the great James Mason seeming to sleepwalk his way in Claude Rains' bigger footsteps, Dyan Cannon in permanent histrionic mode and a cast of many along for the ride. The Oscar nominated score is all sappy MOR muzak too.<br /><br />I've read that Beatty made this film with one eye on the box-office returns to fund his ambitious \"Reds\" project, a film I'll be watching soon and hope was worth it.

{"text": "Since most of the political bellyaching about this movie seems to be coming from the self-righteous right, I'm going to ignore it and just talk about the film itself. What starts out as a well-acted exploration of family tensions - especially those between a relatively uneducated set of middle-class parents and their college-educated son - gives way to the clumsy, overwrought melodramatics of the second half of the film. The death of Robert Walker during filming doesn't really excuse or explain the awfulness of the last hour. There's an early scene between John and his mother in which he explains that his goals are the same as those of the Catholic Church in which they were both raised but that his methods are different. The fact that he is a Communist (McCarey and some of his apologists seem to suggest) means that those goals must be evil because the methods are evil. Just stop thinking for yourself; trust in God and the FBI. It's a dangerous message, and not all that far off from the one that the Communists drilled into their victims (for \"God and the FBI\" substitute \"the Party\"). Oh, well . . . I guess I couldn't avoid the political bellyaching.<br /><br />The sad thing is that the lead actors are all so good. McCarey was brilliant at getting excellent naturalistic performances from his actors, and Helen Hayes, Robert Walker, Van Heflin and Dean Jagger are all extremely convincing until the film collapses into right-wing agitprop at the halfway mark.

Basically because in this movie that's all Josie's ever heard... how she's such a great piece of a$$ (\"the town tease\"), and the redundancy of these comments she's encountered up to now has her almost proud of that fact. \"... I never tease...\" But the truth is, nobody cares who she is as a person (including you the viewer), and that kills her. Those that have criticized and commented on the movie are actually characters IN the movie. As we comment on how beautiful Connelly is, we in turn become a part of Josie's past, and we are responsible for who she is now. Add the issues of her father, who only threatens her (and the cop) with abuse and attempts of control. Josie is physically beautiful, but that is her main problem. She's a really f'ed up chick. She is a temporary trophy, until something better comes along. And being that negative attention is better than no attention at all, you can understand what brought her to the store in the first place. When Jim tells Josie of his dream of her, she instantly thinks \"sex\"... cause up until this point in her life, that all she has to offer anyone. She is instantly caught off guard when Jim suggests a simple dance, one that he's been dreaming of since the 7th grade. And of all the people Josie has ever been with, Jim is the first gentleman she's ever met. And for the first time in both of their lives, a true connection is made. Yes, the Home Alone skits are below average, but for me, the problem is that they take away from the connection that the two leads are making. The best part of this whole movie is the unspoken dialogue between Connelly and Whaley, as they tried desperately to comfort each other in this time of chaos.

Sure, we have David Lynch, Guy Maddin, even David Cronenberg, adding to our wonderful world of extremely disturbing for the sake of disturbing film-making, but could they go to this level? Or am I being unfair to say that this is a different level? It could be the same intent with a different approach...<br /><br />We have three segments, each \"extreme\" in their own way. The first, a shockingly gross-out horror film involving foetophagia (pardon me my neologism if there happens to be a real word for said consumption out there), is about all the wonder in blood and gross biological matter you can possibly compress into gut-churning madness. Too bad it doesn't really have much more to it than that, because honestly once you get over the initial \"gut\" reaction, there's not much more to care about... no spectacular cinematography, nothing really amazing in performances... no real reason to be a movie as opposed to a photograph, a written story, a bad tale told over candlelight. I'll just pretend it's all symbolic of the current issue over stem-cell research and leave it at that.<br /><br />The second segment, by the wonderful Park Chan-Wook of Oldboy fame, gets a little better. Our little friend Park has an eye for torture, I see, as now it involves a movie director and his wife tied to his own house-like set, a disturbed extra putting him through physical and emotional turmoil. This one has no long-winded development of psychological torture-by-hypnotism, this is straight out lose-if-you-do, lose-if-you-don't. The focus on the stage lighting and the levels of truth and deceit make it an interestingly post-modern look at spectatorship, as now these characters are forced to look at each other take up and remove their costumes in a twisted dynamic. Too bad that theme isn't really developed much more than just being there, because again, this film has a little bit less in terms of cinema. It has some neat tricks here and there, just nothing to write home about.<br /><br />The third segment, and my favorite, is from my man the amazing Takashi Miike of Ichi the Killer fame. A much more atmospheric and involving film, indeed, this is the story of a woman who dreams fitfully about her accidental murder of her twin sister at the age of ten, with a slightly more complex plot involving a circus performer and pedophilia. Mostly films that turn out to be \"just a dream\" are kind of disappointing, but this has something fresh to add to the group. It also has the most to offer cinematically, with real care put into editing, production design, imagery, juxtaposition, and whatever possible to embellish mood. Of all the segments, this is the most artsy and lovely, and really a good end to round up the features we've been subjected to.<br /><br />Overall, don't expect to eat comfortably after viewing this film.

Backed by French, Italian and Spanish financers; directed by a Brit; and starring American, Japanese and Swiss leading actors, it is hardly surprising that it seems to draw its inspiration from a muddled patchwork of influences.

Red Sun could have been - perhaps should have been - a good movie, but what it emerges as is, unfortunately, rather a waste of a good idea.", "include": 1}
{"text": "This is a tremendous movie I must say! Unfortunately I only got to watch it on a small poor TV, but the style and plot is still captivating.<br /><br />The strongest point is a very nice style: 50-ish random big city, neither clearly American or European. It is always dark, sun never shines, everything looks a bit run down. Some puddles and rain reinforces the mood.<br /><br />The start of the movie is wonderful in its total mystery; it is really a whole lot like a Kafka novel as the main protagonist walks around in a strange world discovering ever more of it. And it is really really strange in an absolutely wonderful way. <br /><br />The basic premise of aliens putting humans in a lab far out in space and messing with their minds is really nice, and the way they do it interesting enough. However, I felt that the movie dropped some in its intensity when the mechanics behind the scenes get revealed. An unseen horror is always more interesting than a seen horror. <br /><br />The end is a bit disappointing as it all digresses into a \"big fight\" in classic american style. <br /><br />But the final end is nice in that there is no complete happiness, only a hint that things could be getting better. <br /><br />Overall, better than most movies.

Macbeth: The Comedy takes Shakespeare's well-crafted tale and adds a liberal sprinkling of modern low-level American humour. Apart from lots and lots and lots (many) jokes about gays and lesbians there was an attempt to lace the movie with slapstick comedy, presumably lightening the scene. This didn't work at all, being more the kind of slaphead comedy that doesn't make it much onto tv any more. I was pleasantly surprised to find no toilet humour, but the tone wasn't held much about that with much sniggering concerning the abovementioned lesbian and gay characters in the film: for which one must assume there is a reason.

{"text": "TAXI is the American remake of the quirky 1998 Luc Besson comedy. While the core of the film is still oriented around fast cars, hot chicks and zany humour, the film's light-hearted French comedic ambiance has been replaced with a dirtier, more strident, and somewhat more serious American action-comedy feel, which, although it tries hard, doesn't quite translate as it should. Queen Latifah leads as Belle Williams, a taxi driver who runs a souped-up Ford around the meaner streets of the city. Jimmy Fallon plays the unco New York cop who lands in her cab one day in pursuit of a bunch of foxy Brazilian bank robbers. Together, they muddle through car-crashes, shoot-outs and weirdly-decorated apartments to bring crooks to justice. While the plot sounds like a good premise for a decent comedy, the film is sorely lacking in script composition. The one-liners are crap, the jokes feel forced, and the script, which alternates between taking itself too seriously and sheer stupidity, does no justice whatsoever to the energetic and talented cast. A major disappointment from what looked to be a brilliant film. Someone should remake it in six more years - with a little more skill, I hope.", "include": 1}
{"text": "My Rating: * out of ****. <br /><br />I saw Anger Management for the purpose that there was not much else out. Lets just say, I hated it. I think Adam Sandler has an uneven resume, there are movies I like of his and there are some I just dont care for. I have never actually hated one of his movies (although I never saw Little Nicky, nor do I want to), but Anger Management actually begins a new category. Adam Sandler movies that are plain terrible. <br /><br />Anger Management offers an interesting premise. But with all the bad and unfunny jokes its just a mess of a movie. There may have been possibly one time when I laughed, but thats it. Theres a twist at the end that I would have thought was more clever, if the movie had been somewhat watchable.<br /><br />The acting is not much of a strength. I thought Adam Sandler was great in 2002's Punch Drunk Love, but I found him unconvincing and dull here. Jack Nicholson makes his character into a caricature. This performance does call for Nicholson to be over the top, but hes just ridiculous and kind of annoying. I wanted his scenes to be cut or maybe someone else to play the character. Marisa Tomei is somewhat pleasant to save a few scenes of the movie, but she is not in it much. <br /><br />Anger Management could have been good, and thats probably the biggest disappointment. It needed a more intelligent script, and as much as I'm a fan of Jack Nicholson, I dont think he should have been in this movie. Anger Management is a waste of a movie.", "include": 1}

The middle of the film consists of Mona, through magic realism, being transported back to a slave plantation in 18th-century America. For those of you who wonder about what it was like to be a slave back then, under those barbaric and intolerable conditions, this is your chance. \"Sankofa\" is not for the faint of heart. Yet its violent scenes are never overdone, and the film's final 'message' is a positive one.<br /><br />It's a shame that this film at this time has an IMDB \"rating\" of only 5 or so, because 31 of the 44 votes cast have been \"10\"s, including mine.

{"text": "Rather than despairing about the loss of a comedic genius or the choices made by studios or Director Blake Edwards after his death, my review will focus on Trail of the Pink Panther's successful eulogy for the series and the great Peter Sellers. The film is clearly a tribute from its dedication - \"To Peter, the one and only Inspector Clouseau\" to its ambiguous and seemingly symbolic ending.<br /><br />The Pink Panther has been stolen, and Clouseau (Sellers) is on his way to Lugash. Over the ocean, his plane disappears. Is Clouseau really gone or is this just another of his ingenious tricks and is he undercover in Lugash hunting the perpetrator. Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Lom)is at first overjoyed - he may finally be rid of Clouseau - but soon enough he begins to suspect that he will see his former colleague again, and his debilitating obsessions return. Meanwhile, a French reporter (Lumley) begins a series of investigative reports trying to get to the bottom of the Clouseau disappearance. She interviews Cato (Burt Kwouk) and many of Clouseau's enemies, colleagues and acquaintances.<br /><br />Sellers appears in the film only in archive footage and scenes cut from previous films. The same is true for most of the other Panther veterans in the film, but several new Dreyfus scenes were added. The first half of the film, prior to Clouseau's disappearance, hang together well-enough - but it is very clear that we are seeing a film which has been loosely cobbled together from a collage of material. The second half, while more coherent and linearly plotted, lacks Peter Sellers - and - really - just isn't very funny.<br /><br />Lom, Kwouk and Lumley turn in the best performances here, and after Clouseau's disappearance, Lom and Kwouk are really the only performers who occasionally create a laugh.<br /><br />The absence of Peter Sellers is palpable in the second half of the film, and although the film clearly attempts to remain light-hearted and Pantheresque, this absence lends a sadness to Trail of the Pink Panther which makes it a much more successful eulogy than comedy. However, all considered, it is probably the least entertaining film in the Pink Panther canon.", "include": 1}

And that is pretty much all that is discernible from a plot that bounces around more than the heroine when she battles bad guys...and girls. The movie's downfall is its attempt to cram too much of everything into a world and story that is a lot more simple.<br /><br />The film starts off earnestly enough. The sweet tunes of a grand piano gently transport us into an ordinary world that is soon going to come crashing down. And crashing down it does and not in the good 'bashing your opponents face into the pavement' way, but rather in the bland character's, bad acting, convoluted and totally unbelievable story kind of way. Now, before I get into how bad this movie really is I will start with what is good about it. But 'good' certainly does not mean redeemable. The cinematography and camera work are great and truly capture the essence of the places the story takes us. The fight scenes are well-choreographed and well-shot for the most part, which is more than most Hollywood martial arts heavy films can say these days(I am glaring at the insanely hard to follow 'static-cam' of the \"Bourne\" films and Bond's latest foray into an unwelcoming action-genre).<br /><br />And that, viewers, is where the goodness of this hack ends. What follows is a lot of over-acting to the point of hilarity, cheap and pointless one-liners, too many implausible scenarios that don't have any basis in anything related to reality. And yes, I know, this is 'Street Fighter' and it is based on a mildly supernatural video game but some of the events that occur in this film are just too over-the-top(Bison 'delivering' baby scene...enough said). The film raises questions we as viewers shouldn't need to ask...and then we never get answers to those questions! Chun-Li and Gen are the films 'strong' points. Bison is nowhere near as imposing as he should be. And even though his Irish(yes, apparently Bison is Irish) parents died just after he was born and he was raised on the streets of Bangkok with nothing but Thai people, adult Bison somehow managed to retain a spot-on Irish accent. Balrog is just plain hokey. Vega (who is supposed to be a Spaniard, but certainly is not in the film) is...well he just is. His character is neither cool nor threatening and not even as arrogant as he is supposed to be. The characters of Nash and Det. Sunee are totally forgettable and as a matter-of-fact totally unbelievable as well. No decent high-ranking detective, like Sunee claims to be, walks around as scantily clad as she does when she's at work.<br /><br />Oh my God, ladies and gentlemen, I could go on and pick this film apart piece by piece but that would entail me giving away spoilers...and this film has spoiled having only been released yesterday. You wouldn't waste your money on spoiled food would you?

We want their revenge on Akuma and Ryu's scarring bout with Sagat. Simple. Right? No Interpol, no sexy cops, and no Shadaloo (supposed to be Shadow Law btw). You don't need those things to have a great fan pleasing 'Stree Fighter' film do you? I didn't think so. Simple. Simple. Simple. God, I am writer...I should just write the damn thing.

Growing up as I did in the fifties and sixties it would never occur to me to do something as courageous as young Jacob Reinert, not only coming out in Mankato, Minnesota, but bringing his parents into the fight for equality. <br /><br />For too many still gay is something where emotion kicks in and reason just flies out the door. Why is it so, religion and those few bible verses put down for an ancient tribe to make sure they multiplied and dominate, have become the touchstones to justify all kinds of hatred and bigotry.<br /><br />A distinguished group of religious scholars talk about how this came to be in western monotheist religions. There not names you know associated with Christianity or Judaism because there not on the air and in your pocket to stay on the air. They present quite a contrast with the bible thumpers where we see video going back as far as Billy Sunday. <br /><br />The man who comes in for the most scorn is James Dobson, pop psychologist and big kingpin on the religious right. Young Jacob Reinert attempts to confront him, but the most moving story in the film concerned Mary Ann Wallner who listened to Dobson's advice about rejecting her lesbian daughter who later kills herself. <br /><br />For The Bible Tells Me So makes it abundantly clear the political nature of the anti-gay religious right. GLBT people are the 'other' the straw villains you create to justify why the populace should empower your crowd. As Hitler did to the Jews, so the religious right has done to us.<br /><br />My favorite moment in the film was when one of the scholars challenges these religious leaders to obey Jesus's commandment to sell all you have and give it to the poor and then you can follow him. Talk about selective Bible reading, can you see a Pat Robertson doing that? It can never be forgotten that these folks place different emphasis on certain bible verses as opposed to others.<br /><br />My working life consisted in large degree of working at NYS Crime Victims Board as an openly gay investigator. I saw the most manifest examples of anti-gay hate, culminating in violence with serious injury and death. The religious right who keep talking about how our sin is so horrible are the ones who give justification to those who would do us bodily harm. I wish they could see their handiwork from where I sat for 23 years.<br /><br />For The Bible Tells Me So, is an excellent documentary that will hopefully win an Oscar in that category next year.

World War II has ended, and older single women like Louise would like to find Mr. Right and settle down. Enter David, portrayed by Van Heflin, whose ambition is hidden by an exterior that alternates between (1) warm and romantic and (2) cool and aloof. He obviously has strung Louise along for some purpose, and he dumps her when she presses him for a commitment. Like most women of the era, Louise probably has been reared to be emotionally and financially dependent on men, whom she and her contemporaries see as \"strong, secure, brilliant and perfect.\" Whenever a relationship in that era did not work out, society would blame the woman for the failure, never recognizing that men can have flaws, bad motives, and other shortcomings. Hence, there is the neurotic or psychotic condition to which Louise succumbs.<br /><br />It seems obvious to me that David already had staked out a certain business owned by Dean Graham, portrayed by Raymond Massey, and that David was using Louise (Mrs. Graham's nurse) to worm his way into the business and lives of the Graham family and cash in on the goods. Dean, being a kind and well-meaning individual, was blind to David's true ambition to marry Dean's naive and gullible daughter Carol and eventually get control of the business and family fortune. (Of course, once the mission was accomplished, David would use and abandon Carol just as he had used and abandoned Louise). David even brags about his objective to marry Carol and spend the family fortune just before Louise shoots and kills him. However, Louise has her own motives, having internalized the reason for David's abandoning her, and she cannot see the whole picture of David's plot.
